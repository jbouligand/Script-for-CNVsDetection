# Script-for-CNVsDetection
Python scripts to detect CNVs after a Galaxy Diagnostic Analysis.
Analysis of coverage variability between patients of a same Illumina run. 
This script compare depth and coverage data generated by Picard Metrics and downloaded from GalaxyDiagnostic via BioBlend. 
Coverage data are obtained in galaxy for each patient (23 patients, including at least 6 female individuals), from the BAM alignment file using the Picard metrics (Compute both the depth and breadth of coverage, galaxy, tool version 2.22.1). The individual data of each patient are then compared to the average of all female individuals analyzed together in the run with this Python script.

Note : Python script for Python version 2.7
